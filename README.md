Ã˜lpriser i Kristiansand
======
This project is done by 3 students at the University of Agder in Norway.
We have created this android app for comparing beer prices in Kristiansand.
The app is in Norwegian, but the code is in English (except some parts).

To launch the app on your phone: 
  1. Open the "bin"-folder
  2. Copy Priser.apk over to your phone
      - You might need to enable "Unknown sources" in your phone's settings in order to install it
  3. Install the app by clicking on the Priser.apk in your phone
  4. ...
  5. Launch the app by navigating to the app's icon on your phone.
  
If you are a developer and would like to develop more on this app, you are welcome to do so.
Just create a fork or a branch and start coding!
We have included the PHP-files and our database so you can see how we have done it.
The PHP-files need to be uploaded to a webserver in order to get the app to use them.
