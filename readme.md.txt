Thank you for buying stocks in my company. Can i suggest buying some more while they are cheap? I can buy stocks from you.

The best aircraft in the game in the beginning is the Dassault Mercure
costs about 850k and wil earn 50k an hour. so in the first or second day you will have gotten your money back.

Sell the boeing 737 and buy as many Mercures as possible. 


This is a good starter guide.

1.Sell your Boeing 737-800 when sale price is over 80% and buy a few Dassault Mecures aka DMs (under Dassault Aviation in hangar).
2.Buy at least 200 DMs. Use the best advertising possible. Cater after 30-40 in your fleet (Sky+). Put on max range

Buy fuel when it is 400$ or cheaper. Buy the best advertising. it costs like 7k for the most expensive. On all aircrafts.
